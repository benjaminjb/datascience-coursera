datascience-coursera
====================

A repo for class exercises and homework.

During the summer 2014 I took two classes through Coursera in their [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1/courses).

1. The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox -- largely concerned with setting up the computing environment and Github.
2. R Programming -- a more substantive introduction to R.

I took these courses at the same time as I took an Introduction to Programming in Python through Coursera.
