datascience-coursera
====================

A repo for exercises in Data Science classes from Coursera.

During the summer 2014 I took two classes through Coursera in their [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1/courses).

1. The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox -- largely concerned with setting up the computing environment and Github.
2. R Programming -- a more substantive introduction to R.
